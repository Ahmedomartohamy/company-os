# Sprint 1 Step Report

## Guardrails Established

### Scope Restrictions
- **File Modifications**: Apply ONLY to files explicitly listed under "Files you MAY touch"
- **Prohibited Actions**: Do NOT edit, rename, or delete any files outside the specified scope
- **No Unauthorized Changes**: Avoid refactors beyond what is explicitly requested

### Development Constraints
- **No Styling Overhaul**: Maintain existing UI/UX patterns
- **No Dependency Upgrades**: Keep current package versions unless specifically required
- **Small, Isolated Diffs**: Minimize changes to reduce risk and complexity

### Decision Making Protocol
- **Ambiguity Handling**: STOP and document in report rather than making assumptions
- **Documentation Requirement**: Always create/update report files under `docs/sprint-1/`
- **Report Naming**: Use descriptive names like `STEP-REPORT.md` for each step

## Sprint 1 Focus Areas

Based on Sprint 0 closeout recommendations:

### Primary Objectives
1. **Contacts Management System**
   - Extend client relationship capabilities
   - Implement CRUD operations for contacts
   - Integrate with existing client data

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implement permission system
   - Add role-based route protection
   - Update authentication flow

### Technical Considerations
- Database schema updates may be required
- New service layers for contacts management
- Enhanced security for role-based access
- Integration testing for new features

## Current Status

**Guardrails Acknowledged**: ✅
**Sprint 1 Directory Created**: ✅
**Ready for Specific Tasks**: ✅

## Next Steps

Awaiting specific task instructions that will:
1. Define exact files that may be modified
2. Specify implementation requirements
3. Provide clear acceptance criteria
4. Outline any database changes needed
