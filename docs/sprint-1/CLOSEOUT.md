## Smoke Test Checklist

### Test 1: Admin User Flow

**Prerequisites:** Login as user with `admin` role

1. ✅ Navigate to `/contacts`
2. ✅ Verify "Add Contact" button is visible
3. ✅ Click "Add Contact" and fill form
4. ✅ Submit form and verify contact appears in list
5. ✅ Click on contact to view details
6. ✅ Click "Edit" button and modify contact
7. ✅ Save changes and verify updates
8. ✅ Click "Delete" button and confirm deletion
9. ✅ Verify contact is removed from list

**Expected Result:** Admin can perform all CRUD operations

### Test 2: Sales Rep User Flow

**Prerequisites:** Login as user with `sales_rep` role

1. ✅ Navigate to `/contacts`
2. ✅ Verify "Add Contact" button is visible
3. ✅ Create a new contact (assign self as owner)
4. ✅ Verify contact appears in list
5. ✅ Click on own contact to view details
