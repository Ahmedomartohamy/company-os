## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for data fetching
- Zod for form validation
- Sonner for toast notifications
- Lucide React for icons
- Existing UI components (Modal, Button, etc.)

### Data Flow
- Details page fetches single opportunity by ID
- Form uses existing createOpportunity/updateOpportunity functions
- Client data fetched from clientsService
- Stage data passed from pipeline context

### Error Handling
- Network errors displayed with user-friendly messages
- Form validation errors shown inline
- Loading states prevent user confusion
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Testing Considerations
- All RBAC scenarios should be tested
- Form validation edge cases
- Navigation flows between components
- Modal open/close behavior
- Data refresh after mutations

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All requirements implemented and integrated successfully.

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and maintains consistency with the current architecture. All RBAC requirements are respected, and the user experience is smooth with proper loading states and error handling.
