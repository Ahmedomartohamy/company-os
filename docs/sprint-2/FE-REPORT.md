  - CRUD operations with TanStack Query integration
  - Convert lead functionality with Supabase RPC
  - Lead statistics and filtering capabilities

### UI Components

  - Data table with filtering and search
  - Status and source filters
  - RBAC-enforced action buttons (View, Edit, Delete, Convert)
  - Arabic RTL support

### Module Structure
- **`src/modules/leads/index.ts`** - Module exports

## Routes Added

### Route Configuration
- **`src/constants/routes.ts`** - Added `leads: "/leads"` constant
- **`src/app/Router.tsx`** - Registered `/leads` route with LeadsList component

### Available Routes
- `/leads` â†’ LeadsList component (protected route)

## RBAC Implementation

### Permission Mapping
The following permissions are enforced in the UI using `useAuthz()` hook:

| Permission | Resource | Roles | Description |
|------------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `leads.view` | leads | all roles | View leads list and details |
| `leads.create` | leads | admin, sales_manager, sales_rep | Create new leads |
| `leads.update` | leads | admin, sales_manager, ownerOnly for sales_rep | Update existing leads |
| `leads.delete` | leads | admin only | Delete leads |
| `leads.convert` | leads | same as leads.update | Convert leads to clients |

### Owner-based Access Control
- Sales representatives can only update/convert leads they own
- Owner check compares `record.owner_id` with current user ID
- Buttons are hidden/disabled based on permissions

## Data Model

### Lead Schema
```typescript
interface Lead {
  id?: string;
  first_name?: string;
  last_name?: string;
  company?: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  source: 'website' | 'referral' | 'ads' | 'social' | 'cold_call' | 'other';
  status: 'new' | 'contacted' | 'qualified' | 'unqualified';
  score: number; // 0-100
  owner_id?: string;
  notes?: string;
  created_at?: string;
}
```

### Validation Rules
- Either `first_name` OR `company` is required
- Email must follow valid pattern (optional)
- Score must be between 0-100
- Default status: 'new'
- Default source: 'other'

## Convert Lead Flow - How to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
1. User must have `leads.convert` permission
2. Lead must exist in the system
3. User must be owner of the lead (for sales_rep role)

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Navigate to Leads**: Go to `/leads` page
2. **Find Lead**: Use search or filters to locate the lead
3. **Click Convert**: Click the convert button (arrow icon) for the desired lead
4. **Choose Client Option**:
   - **Existing Client**: Search and select from dropdown
   - **New Client**: Check "Create new client" and it will use company name
5. **Contact Creation**: Toggle "Create contact" option (default ON)
6. **Submit**: Click "Convert Lead" button
7. **Success**: Toast notification appears and user is redirected to client details page

### Expected Results
- Lead status may be updated to 'qualified'
- New client created (if selected)
- New contact created (if enabled)
- User redirected to `/clients/:clientId`
- Success toast notification displayed

### Error Handling
- Permission denied: Button hidden/disabled
- Network errors: Error toast with retry option
- Validation errors: Form validation messages
- RPC errors: Detailed error messages in console

## Arabic RTL Support

### Implementation Details
- All labels and text in Arabic
- Proper RTL text direction
- Icon positioning adjusted for RTL
- Form layout optimized for Arabic text
- Date formatting in Arabic locale

### UI Components
- Status badges with Arabic labels
