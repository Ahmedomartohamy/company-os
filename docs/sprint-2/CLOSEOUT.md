- Updated `src/components/common/Sidebar.tsx` - Added Leads navigation item

### Documentation
- `docs/sprint-2/FE-REPORT.md` - Technical implementation details
- `docs/sprint-2/DB-REPORT.md` - Database schema and migration details
- `TEST-USERS.md` - Test user accounts documentation
- Updated `README.md` - Added test accounts section

## Routes Implemented
- `/leads` - Main leads listing page
- `/leads/new` - Create new lead form

## RBAC Verification Table

| Role | View Leads | Create Lead | Edit Own Lead | Edit All Leads | Delete Lead | Convert Lead |
|------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Sales Manager** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Sales Rep** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Viewer** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### RBAC Implementation Details
- Database-level RLS policies enforce permissions
- UI components use `useAuthz` hook to show/hide actions
- Role-based button visibility and form access control
- Error handling for unauthorized actions
